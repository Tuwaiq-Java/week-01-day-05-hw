Main : 

```
        FullTimeEmployee fullTimeEmployee1=new FullTimeEmployee(1,"Saleh",100);
        FullTimeEmployee fullTimeEmployee2=new FullTimeEmployee(2,"Ali",50);

        PartTimeEmployee partTimeEmployee1=new PartTimeEmployee(1,"Khalid",8,100);
        PartTimeEmployee partTimeEmployee2=new PartTimeEmployee(2,"Noura",5,3);

        Company company=new Company("Tuwaiq");

        company.add(fullTimeEmployee1);
        company.add(fullTimeEmployee2);

        company.add(partTimeEmployee1);
        company.add(partTimeEmployee2);

        System.out.println(company);
        System.out.println(company.computeAmount());
```       

Output : 

```
Company{payables=[Employee{id=1, name='Saleh'}, Employee{id=2, name='Ali'}, Employee{id=1, name='Khalid'}, Employee{id=2, name='Noura'}], name='Tuwaiq'}
1415.0
